Part backorders is a common supply chain problem, wherein a customer places an order for a product that is temporarily out of stock. The percentage of items backordered and the number of backorder days are important measures of the quality of a company's customer service and the effectiveness of its inventory management. A company can manage its inventory more efficiently using a prediction on the backorder risk for the products. Goal here is to use the past data around the backorders, and provide a prediction on the potential products for backorders.The dataset is available on https://data.world/amitkishore/can-you-predict-products-back-order
